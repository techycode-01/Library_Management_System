- **Author Management**: Add, update, view, and delete authors.
- **Book Management**: Add, update, view, and delete books. Filter books by genre.
- **Member Management**: Add, update, view, and delete library members.
- **Loan Management**: Add, update, view, and delete loan records.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: H2 Database (In-memory)
- **Dependency Management**: Maven
- **Build Tool**: Spring Boot Maven Plugin

## Project Structure
- **Controller Layer**: Manages HTTP requests and interacts with services.
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and interacts with DAO.
- **DAO Layer**: Data access objects for handling database operations.
- **DTO Layer**: Response structure for consistent API responses.

## Future Improvements
- **Authentication**: Implement user authentication and authorization.
- **Persistent Database**: Integrate a persistent relational database like MySQL.
- **Front-End**: Develop a user-friendly front-end using ReactJS or Angular.
